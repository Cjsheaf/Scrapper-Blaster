     * Generates a point randomly within a circle of the given radius and constraints. With the appropriate constraints, will generate points only within a slice of the circle.

     * @param theta How wide the arc is (in radians). The point will be forced to be generated somewhere in the arc, relative to the origin.
     * <p>For example, 2*PI means the point can be generated anywhere in the circle and 0.5*PI means it can be generated in a quarter-circle.</p>
     * @param offset The angle (in radians) added to the arc calculated by using the theta.
     * <p>For example, a theta of 0.1*PI will give an arcwidth of a 20th of a circle(a tenth of half a circle), initially directed from the standard position if no offset is given.
     * Using an offset of PI (half a circle) will direct it in exactly the opposite direction from the standard position (adds the equivalent of 180 degrees).</p>
