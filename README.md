Scrapper-Blaster
================

My first published game. Commissioned by and hosted on the website www.pinpics.com (although somewhat buried near the bottom of the page). Click fake pins to blast them into oblivion.

The provided program is written to run in a window as a regular desktop application. This is in contrast to the version hosted online, which is run inside a web browser as a Java Applet embedded into a web page. To run the program, simply compile the program and call main() in class ScrapBlaster.
